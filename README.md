## Usage

Open the window using the gameframe menu.

The maintain tab displays and allows you to edit package manifest details
It also has a button for updating the README file.

Gameframe->Packages->Create
The create tab is used for creating new packages.
You can create packages either embeded in the Unity project or in the chosen source directory.

Gameframe->Packages->Embed
The embed tap will scan the source directory for packages.
Clicking the 'embed' button on a package will create a softlink to the package in the project's Packages folder.
